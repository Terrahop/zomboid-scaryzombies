# Scary Zombies

## Description

Re-textured zombies to add more blood and gore.

This mod aims to make zombies more scary and sinister by adding blood, gore and new features like exposed rib cage or guts out, or half face torn off for our beloved zombies.

There is also some time scaling - older corpses will have more rotting going on, and will have darker blood and gore on them, sores and rot spots etc

## COMPATABILITY

This mod retextures zombies so it will not work with mods which also retexture zombie bodies
(ex: [Afraid of Monsters](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2499635888)) and will work perfectly with most(perhaps any) of cloth mods
